README 

This sample program demonstrates some features of the LVGL embedded GUI
library v7.6.1 ((c) 2020 LVGL LLC):

	https://github.com/lvgl/lvgl
	https://lvgl.io

The program can be controlled with an USB mouse or with the official Raspberry
Pi touch screen and is itself only a wrapper, which uses the LVGL widgets demo
program from this project:

	https://github.com/lvgl/lv_examples

To build the sample you have to clone the LVGL and lv_examples projects
first, which are included as Git sub-modules into Circle. To do this, just
enter:

	git submodule update --init addon/lvgl/lvgl
	git submodule update --init addon/lvgl/lv_examples

Before build you may have to set the wanted screen resolution in the file
lv_conf.h. Search for LV_HOR_RES_MAX and LV_VER_RES_MAX in this file.

First build the Circle libraries from Circle project root, then the LVGL
and lv_examples libraries by entering "make" in the addon/lvgl/ directory.
Finally the sample can be built with "make" in addon/lvgl/sample/.

Please note that the system generates log messages on screen, when an USB mouse
is connected, while the program is running. This destroys the displayed GUI. To
prevent this, you should add the following option to the file cmdline.txt to
direct the log output to the serial interface:

	logdev=ttyS1
